# Cosmic Mystery: Rescuing the Lost Passengers of Spaceship Titanic
## Introduction
Welcome to the year 2912, where we embark on a mission to solve a cosmic mystery and rescue the lost passengers of Spaceship Titanic. In this interstellar adventure, we find ourselves facing a challenging situation: a collision with a hidden spacetime anomaly that has transported almost half of the passengers to an alternate dimension. Using our advanced data science skills, we aim to analyze the recovered records from the spaceship's damaged computer system and predict which passengers were affected by the anomaly.

## Objective
Our primary objective is to aid the rescue crews in identifying and retrieving the passengers who were transported to the alternate dimension. By applying cutting-edge data science techniques, we strive to uncover patterns, anomalies, and indicators within the recovered records that can guide us in distinguishing between the passengers who remained on board and those who were displaced.

## Data Analysis and Modeling
To accomplish our mission, we will leverage the power of data analysis and modeling techniques. The recovered records from the spaceship's computer system will serve as the foundation of our investigation. These records contain valuable information about the passengers, such as personal details, travel itineraries, and various onboard activities.

## Our approach will involve several steps:

Data Preprocessing: We will begin by cleaning and organizing the data, handling missing values, and ensuring its integrity. This step is crucial to prepare the dataset for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, we will gain insights into the passengers' profiles and interactions before the collision. This process will involve visualizations, statistical summaries, and feature engineering to uncover meaningful patterns and potential variables of interest.

Anomaly Detection: Given the spacetime anomaly's influence on the passengers' transportation, we will employ anomaly detection techniques to identify any irregularities or unexpected behaviors in the data. These anomalies may serve as indicators of the passengers who were transported to the alternate dimension.

Machine Learning Modeling: We will develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms to classify the passengers into two groups: those who remained onboard and those who were transported by the anomaly. By training our models on a labeled subset of the data, we will aim to accurately predict the fate of the remaining passengers.

## Expected Outcome
Upon successful completion of our data analysis and modeling, we anticipate two major outcomes:

Identification of Lost Passengers: By analyzing the recovered records and applying our predictive models, we aim to identify the passengers who were transported to the alternate dimension. This information will be invaluable for the rescue crews, enabling them to focus their efforts on retrieving the affected individuals.

Lessons for Future Space Travel: Through our investigation, we will gather insights and learnings that can help prevent similar incidents in the future. By understanding the factors that led to the collision and its consequences, we can contribute to the advancement of interstellar passenger transportation and enhance safety measures for upcoming missions.

## Conclusion
As we embark on this mission to rescue the lost passengers of Spaceship Titanic, our data science skills will play a vital role in unraveling the cosmic mystery and changing history. By analyzing the recovered records, leveraging advanced techniques, and applying machine learning models, we aim to predict which passengers were affected by the spacetime anomaly. Together, let us save lives, rewrite destiny, and propel the future of interstellar exploration.
